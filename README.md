# Word-Sense-Disambiguation-WSD

This work is on "BENGALI Language".
It is my M.Sc. final year project based on NLP (Natural Language Processing).

In Bengali language there are many words which have multiple meanings. In general, they are called ambiguous words and the challenge is to figure out which of these meanings is used in a particular sentence.
  
In this project, I have tried to find out the exact meaning of an ambiguous word in a particular sentence.
